# Cup Fighters :trophy:
Cup Fighters is an online tournament building tool. You can use it to create a tournament for your favourite football (:soccer:) video game of choice. You can find it on [cupfighters.thomaskamermans.com](https://cupfighters.thomaskamermans.com). Best experienced on a screen larger than your mobile phone, with some friends in the same room.

## How does it work

**Set up**

You can create a tournament with 6 to 16 friends. All the players will be drawn in 2 to 4 groups. Fill in a fitting name for your tournament. You'll be asked to add all players that are participating. Based on the amount of players you'll be given the choice of the group sizes and the amount of players that'll be left in the knock-out stage.

**Group stage**

This is where the fun begins. The players have to play a match against everyone in their group. The tables will be live updated. In case of unequal amount of groups the best players ended third will also go through.

**Knock-out stage**

A knock-out table will be shown. Matches will be played the same way in the group stage, with exception for games that end in a draw. You'll be prompted with the option to select the winner from a penalty shoot-out.

**Statistics**

The winner has been crowned. Now it's time for statistics. Who has scored the most goals. Who has the most clean sheets.

## Techniques used
- **React.js** has been used to build the user interface.
- **Redux.js** to save the application state, in your local storage. See for yourself; create a tournament, close the browser and open it again.
- **Jest** to test if all is correct
- **Bootstrap** as a basis to work from
